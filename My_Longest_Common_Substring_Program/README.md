This longest common substring program I wrote is based on the algorithm I developed.

I takes strings separated with commas (i.e. ",") as input and returns all the longest common substrings (incase there are more than one common substrings) of the entered strings as a list. Incase it's just one, It returns it as a string.

Enjoy:)
