This program finds the transpose of matrices of any shape.
The matrices are to be entered in form of nested lists with each list in the list representing the rows of the matrix.
E.g. if A = | 5 4 3 |
	    | 3 1 2 |
	    | 0 1 5 |,
Matrix A should be represented as: [[5,4,3], [3,1,2], [0,1,5]]
The output will also be presented in the format of the input.

I included a pseudocode for better explanation of the program.
Enjoy!
